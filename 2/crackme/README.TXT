 FaNt0m's CrackMe #2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This crackme is very simple, you just have to get rid of the nag screens.
There are two nag screens, a message box and a dialog box.  Both of them
are displayed at the beginning of the program.

 Rules
~~~~~~~
 - Patch the file to prevent the MesageBox and the DialogBox from showing
 - You cannot delete the dialog from the resource
 - Write up some sort of document (.txt or .html) which explains how
   and where you patched the program.  As well how you found where to patch
 - Bonus: Write a program to patch the exe file

If you have any questions, comments or problems you can contact me on IRC
on the Efnet in #new2cracking or #cracking4newbies.  You can email me, but
I don't check my email very often, your better off seeing me on IRC.
