 FaNt0m's CrackMe #8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have finally created crackme 8, it has been quite a bit of fun making this
one.  I am interested in your feedback as to how hard you think this crackme
or any of my crakcmes are.  On my crackme #7 I posted on my website Medium
difficulty, when it turned out it wasn't, it was rather easy.  Therefore I am
requesting the crackers out there to send me your opinion of the difficulty.
I have also moved my website to a server without banners, I have had many
complaints about this and therefore have resolved the issues.  Also, I found
out that cjb.net is now posting pop-ups so i have switched to n3.net, however
you can still use cjb.net, but you'll get annoying pop-ups.

Now onto the info of the crackme.  This crackme has multiple protections, the
first one you'll notice is the softice detection.  The next is that the dll
and exe are both packed.  And the third is not really a protection but the
function for the serial is in the dll, so you gotta know how to navigate a
dll with ease :).  Anyways, hope you enjoy this one!

 Rules / Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Unpack the exe and dll (should be really easy)
 - Remove the SoftICE detection (by patching, unless you know another way)
 - Find a correct serial for your nick
 - Bonus: Make up a keygen
 - Bonus: Write up a tut and I'll post it on my webpage!

If you have any questions, comments or problems you can contact me on IRC
on the Efnet in #new2cracking, #winprog or #asm.  You can email me, but
I don't check my email very often, your better off seeing me on IRC.
