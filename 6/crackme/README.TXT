 FaNt0m's CrackMe #6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This crackme is an easy one.  It has keyfile protection, which means there
should be a file with a valid key inside it.  The trick here is you have to
create the file.  This involves finding what the name of the file should be
and filling it with correct values.  I have not seen many programs today
which currently use the keyfile protection, but its still a good idea to know
how to crack :).  

 Rules / Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Create a file which holds a valid key
 - Find out what a valid key is
 - No patching! (don't make it say you have a valid key wihtout having one)
 - No resource hacking ;)

If you have any questions, comments or problems you can contact me on IRC
on the Efnet in #new2cracking or #cracking4newbies.  You can email me, but
I don't check my email very often, your better off seeing me on IRC.
