 FaNt0m's CrackMe #1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This crackme is very simple, you just have to find out the password.
To do this crackme, all you need to do is load it into a disassembler
and you'll see how easy this crackme really is!

 Rules
~~~~~~~
 - Find the correct password
 - Do NOT use Soft Ice or any other debugger!
 - You must use only a disassembler/Hex-editor
 - Bonus: Patch the file so it doesn't matter what the input is

If you have any questions, comments or problems you can contact me on IRC
on the Efnet in #new2cracking or #cracking4newbies.  You can email me, but
I don't check my email very often, your better off seeing me on IRC.

ttyl,
