 FaNt0m's CrackMe #7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once again, I sit here behind my keyboard and attempt to think of information
to provide the cracker with; Good information but not giving away the secret
to the protection.  I once had someone on the net say they think I shouldn't
provide any information about the crack, just let the cracker figure it out!
In reality this is a good idea, however my crackmes are mostly aimed towards
the newbies, whom need a little help to get started.  If you don't want the
little hints I provide to you then stop reading the readme.txt files :)

So, now onwards to discuss this crackme.  This crackme has a trial limit on
it which only allows the user to check their crack 30 times.  After that
period you will be notified that your time is up.  Your job as a cracker is
to find the protection and eliminate it so the program will always run
without the limitations set on the program.  There are two ways to do this
crackme, an easy way and a hard way :) its up to you!

 Rules / Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Eliminate the protection by patching
 - Make sure the program doesn't show any message boxes when "Check" is hit
 - Bonus: Write a patcher
 - Bonus: Write a tutorial and send it to me and i'll put it on my webpage

If you have any questions, comments or problems you can contact me on IRC
on the Efnet in #new2cracking.  You can email me, but I don't check my email
very often, your better off seeing me on IRC.
