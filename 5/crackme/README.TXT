 FaNt0m's CrackMe #5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alrighty... here it is, CrackMe #5!  This is a test of your skill... if you
have been practicing my first four crackmes, then you should have no problem.
However, if you have not, and are a newbie, you may have trouble finishing
this crackme.

You will find four differnt types of protection on this application.  Each
protection is taken from a different crackme I've written (1-4).  Take your
time doing this crackme, don't get fustrated! If you can't solve it, go play
Return to Castle Wolfentstein some more and then come back to this when you
can think clearly :)

 Rules / Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - No resource hacking! (This means you DarkMooN`) ;)
 - Find the Password 
 - Patch the crackme to make the program believe this is your CDROM
 - Patch it once again to get rid of the Nags (dialogs and MsgBox)
 - Find a serial for your name (or nick)
 - Bonus: write a program to patch the cd check and nags
 - Bonus: write a keygen for the serial
 - Super Bonus: Reverse Engineer this crackme to display a message box
                with greets and your nick when the About menu is clicked
                instead of loading the dialog box

If you have any questions, comments or problems you can contact me on IRC
on the Efnet in #new2cracking or #cracking4newbies.  You can email me, but
I don't check my email very often, your better off seeing me on IRC.
