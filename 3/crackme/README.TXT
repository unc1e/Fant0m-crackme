 FaNt0m's CrackMe #3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This crackme is very simple, you just have to make the computer think you
have a cdrom :).  Just simply patch the program so that you see the right
messagebox.

 Rules
~~~~~~~
 - Patch the file to prevent the cdrom error messagebox
 - Write up some sort of document (.txt or .html) which explains how
   and where you patched the program.  As well how you found where to patch
 - Bonus: Write a program to patch the exe file

If you have any questions, comments or problems you can contact me on IRC
on the Efnet in #new2cracking or #cracking4newbies.  You can email me, but
I don't check my email very often, your better off seeing me on IRC.

ttyl,
